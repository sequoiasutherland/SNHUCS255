1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a course-long project which followed the development process from initial client meeting through the final planning presentation. My work included analyzing the client's needs and then creating UML and other diagrams and using project mapping tools to plan the system that would be designed for DriverPass. This included the application's functional and nonfunctional features, the project timeline, user workflows, and more.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I think one of my strengths in this project was my ability to coordinate the execution of documents that would be understandable to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders in the DriverPass project. Being able to bring stakeholders from different backgrounds onto the same page during project development is a critical skill for project management and design.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would have liked to spend more time on the hardware requirements section. I think my recommendations here were sufficient but were certainly not robust and could include more that would allow DriverPass to make a more well informed decision. 

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are priority when designing a system. The system can be as high quality in respect to UX or operating speed, but if it does not address the user's needs then the system will not be used. I paid particular attention to the initial interview script and read it several times throughout the project to ensure I never left out any functionality. 

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
This was my first experience with the system of designing software, and I thought it was very interesting and a beneficial skill to have as a developer. I think that proper planning is essential to completing any project, especially complex projects, in a way that saves resources and overperforms. I will certainly take the tools I learned in this course with me when working on similar projects in the future.
